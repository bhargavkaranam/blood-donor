### How do I get set up? ###

* Type npm install
* And then npm start
* Open another window of command line and type ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --progress --watch
* The app should be running at http://localhost:8080/

#Improvements

* Everything was perfect but in the case of Angular, I was currently hands on AngularJS 1.5, i wrote the mail to cross over team also and got the suggestion to work on Angular 1.5 but mention it with reason, so instead of starting on Angular, i took the challange and brushed ReactJS and starting working on same.

* Lazy load feature: from your current location it will show the donors in the radius of 5KM. The improvement can be done to show donors in map scrolling but could not do it due to time constarint.
